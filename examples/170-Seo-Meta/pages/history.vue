    In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for
    "C-like Object Oriented Language".[24] Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the
    language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the
    July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and
    ASP.NET
    runtime had been ported to C#.
